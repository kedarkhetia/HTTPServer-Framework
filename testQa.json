The instructions will tell you how, but you probably will figure it out just by going to that menu on your phone. There are also online support sites. You pair it to the phone, then it will connect automatically when you turn it on. It's easy! This is a very good bluetooth headset, in my opinion...and the price makes it even better. Best wishes!"}
